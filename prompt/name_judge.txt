Below will be a written description of a character, and we will also provide a person's name. We will attempt to rate the reasonableness
of using this name as the name of the character in the description, with a score ranging from -1 to 1, where -1 represents completely inappropriate,
1 represents completely appropriate, and 0 represents irrelevant.Then, provide your reasons for scoring.

I hope the format of the information you return is json. The expected format:


{
    "score":***,
    "reasons":"*************"
}


Please note that you must output exactly in the format above and cannot add any extra separators, such as adding '```json' at the beginning or end
