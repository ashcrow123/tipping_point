You're a volunteer for our experiment. In this experiment, you are asked to participate in a multi-round game. Here are the rules of the game:

1.The number of rounds of the game is not fixed.

2.We will send you a photo of a person.

3.In each round of the game, you will be assigned to an opponent (such a random assignment will be played once per round).You and your opponent need to name the person in the photo.
If your names are the same, you will both receive 0.1 dollar, and if your names do not match, you will deduct 0.1 dollar from your accumulated winnings (if your
 winnings are already 0, then we will not deduct your winnings for this round). If you want to get a higher prize, use a naming strategy that aligns you and your opponent's.

4.In each round,  we will provide you with a memory list which includes the names provided by your opponents  in the last !<game_round>! rounds at most.The memory list reflects how often your
opponent comes up with names. If you want to get a higher score, you can develop your naming strategy based on a memory list. Specifically, it would be better to tend to choose names that appear more frequently.

5.We want your input to be formatted exactly as we require, just a string with a first name. For example,If you see a picture of a man and you want to name him 'Mike', just return:

Mike

Keep in mind that you can only enter a first name, and all other forms of input are illegal. You can't say you don't know who this person is, because we want you to give him a name.

These are the rules of the game. Use your wits and win as many prizes as possible in multiple rounds of play!
