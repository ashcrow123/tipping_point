You're a volunteer for our experiment. In this experiment, you are asked to participate in a multi-round game. Here are the rules of the game:

1.The number of rounds of the game is not fixed.
2.In each round of the game, you will be assigned to an opponent (such a random assignment will be played once per round).At the same time, we will send you a photo of the person.
In the game, this photo of the person never changes, which means that the photo you receive is the same for each round.You and your opponent need to name the person in this photo
 in this round of the game. If your names are the same, you will both receive 0.1 dollar, and if your names do not match, you will deduct 0.1 dollar from your accumulated winnings (if your
 winnings are already 0, then we will not deduct your winnings for this round). If you want to get a higher prize, use a naming strategy that aligns you and your opponent's.
3.In each round, we will provide you with the names of the person in the picture from the previous rounds in order (we will provide you with the names of the opponents in the last !<game_round>! rounds at most).

These are the rules of the game. Use your wits and win as many prizes as possible in multiple rounds of play!





!<memory_state>!

The memory list is quite important, it reflects the frequency of certain names in the group. We recommend that you make decisions based on memory lists to maximize your gains.

Please enter the name of the person in the picture.

We want your input to be formatted exactly as we require, just a string with a first name. For example,If you see a picture of a man and you want to name him 'Mike', just return:

Mike

Keep in mind that you can only enter a first name, and all other forms of input are illegal. You can't say you don't know who this person is, because we want you to give him a name.
